WiFi Password Cracker

This Python script is designed to scan for available WiFi networks and attempt to connect to them using a list of passwords. It uses the pywifi library to manage WiFi connections and is designed for educational and testing purposes. Below is a README text to help users understand and use the script:
Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

    Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

    Required Libraries: You will need the following Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
        pywifi: This library provides functionality to manage WiFi connections.
        concurrent.futures: This library is used for managing concurrent execution of tasks.
        time: This is a standard Python library for handling time-related operations.

    WiFi Adapter: Ensure you have a compatible WiFi adapter installed and enabled on your system.

    Password List: Prepare a text file containing a list of passwords that you want to attempt when connecting to WiFi networks.

Usage Instructions

    Clone or download the script to your local machine.

    Open the script in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

    Update the password_list_file variable with the correct path to your password list file. Ensure that the password list file contains one password per line.

    Save your changes and run the script. It will scan for available WiFi networks and attempt to connect to them using the passwords from the provided list.

    The script will create a file named successful_connections.txt to log successful connections. If a successful connection is made, the script will record the SSID (network name) and the password used.

    You can adjust the maximum number of concurrent connection attempts by modifying the max_workers parameter in the ThreadPoolExecutor context manager. Be cautious with this value, as attempting too many connections concurrently may trigger security measures on the WiFi network.

    The script will attempt to connect to all available WiFi networks in range. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access and attempt to connect to these networks.

    This script is for educational and testing purposes only. Unauthorized access to WiFi networks is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and legal rights to use this script.

Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:
password_list_file = "path_to_your_password_list.txt"
scan_and_attempt_connections(password_list_file)
